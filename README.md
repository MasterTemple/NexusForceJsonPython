Once it functions completely I'll show how to use.\
Currently the plan is to convert all objects and missions from the cdclient.sqlite to json for the Nexus Force bot I made. This will be using lcdr's fdb -> sqlite and then I convert sqlite -> json usable by the bot. This will allow the bot to be useful after content updates or balance changes.
Yes its python not JS cause JS was a pain.
